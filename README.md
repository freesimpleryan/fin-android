Android Client for Financial Project

This project needs the server componenet (fin-server) to run. If the server is not running, the results will not display at the end. Server can be modified at `Data._URL`

This is a kiosk app designed to gather financial data for the provider and provide budgeting results to the user. Data is passed to the provider upon completion of all user dialogs before results are passed back to the user.
